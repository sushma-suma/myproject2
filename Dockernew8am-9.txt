Virtualization
===================
This is the process of running multiple OS's parallelly on
a single pice of h/w.
Here we have h/w(bare metal) on top of which we have host os
and on the host os we install an application called as hypervisor
On the hypervisor we can run any no of OS's as guest OS

The disadvantage of this approach is these application running on the
guest OS have to pass through n number of lavers to access the H/W
resources.

Containarization
======================
Here we have bare metal on top of whcih we install the host Os
and on the hsot OS we install an application called as Docker Engine
On the docker engine we can run any application in the form of containers
Docker is a technology for creating thse containers

Docker achive what is commonly called as "process isolation"
ie all the applications(processes) have some dependency on a specific
OS.This dependency is removed by docker and we can run them on any
OS as containers if we have Docker engine installed

These containers pass through less no of layers to access the h/w resources
also organizations need not spend money on purchasing licenses of different
OS's to maintian various applications

Docker can be used at the the stages of S/W development life cycle
Build---->Ship--->Run



===========================================================================
Docker comes in 2 flavours
Docker CE (Community Edition)
Docker EE (Enterprise Edition)

Setup of Docker on Windows 
==============================
1 Download docker desktop from
  https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

2 Install it

3 Once docker is installed we can use Power shell
  to run the docker commands


========================================================================
Day 2
========================================================================
Images and Containers
===========================
A Docker image is a combination of bin/libs that are necessary
for a s/w application to work.Initially all the s/w's of docker 
are available in the form of docker images

A running instance of an image is called as a container


Docker Host: The server where docker is installed is called
               docker host


==========================================================================

FAIQ. Explain the architecture of Docker

Docker Client:This is the CLI of docker where the user can execute the
docker commands,The docker client accepts these commands and passes them
to a background process called "docker deamon"

Docker deamon: This process accepts the commands coming from the docker client
and routes them to work on docker images or containers or the docker registry

Docker registry: This is the cloud site of docker where docker images are
stored.This is of two types
1 Public Registry( hub.docker.com)
2 Private Registry(Setup on one of our local servers)


===========================================================================

     Click on Continue--->Enter password: secret

=========================================================================
Day 6
==========================================================================
Docker compose
=======================
The disadvantage of "link" option is it is depricated and 
the same individual command have to be given multiple times
to setup similar architectures.
To avaoid this we can use docker compose
Docker compose uses yml files to setup the multu container 
architecture and these files can be resused any number of time

Setup of docker compose

1 Download the docker compose s/w
  sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

2 Give execute permissions on it
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

3 To check if docker compose is installed or not
  docker-compose --version


Url: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

  container_name: firefox
...

To setup the above architecture
docker-compose up -d

To check the running containers
docker container ls

To delete the containers
docker-compose down

============================================================================
Docker Volumes
====================
Containers are ephemeral(temporary) but the data processed by the
containers should be persistent.Once a container is delete all the 
data of the container is lost
To preserve the data even if the container is deleted we can use volumes

Volumes are classified into 3 types
======================================
1 Simple docker volume
2 Sharable dokcer volumes
3 Docker volume containers

Simple Docker volumes
===========================
These voluems are used only for preserving the data on the host
machine even if the containers is deleted

UsedCase
============
Create a directory /data and mount it as a volume on an ubuntu container
Create some files in the mounted volumes and check if the files
are preserved on the host machine even after the container is deleted

1 Create /data directory
  mkdir /data

2 Create an ubuntu container and mount the above directory as volume
  docker run --name u1 -it -v /data ubuntu
  In the container u1 go into /data directory and create some files
  cd /data
  touch file1 file2 file3
  exit

3 Identify the locatiuon where the mounted data is preserved
  docker inspect u1
  Search for "Mounts" section and copy the "Source" path

4 Delete the container
  docker rm -f u1

5 Check if the data is still present
  cd "source_path_from_step3"
  ls
======================================================================
Sharable Docker volumes
============================
These volumes are sharabale between multiple containers

Create 3 centos containers c1,c2,c3.
Mount /data as a volume on c1 container ,c2 should use the volume
used by c1 and c3 should use the volume used by c2

1 Create a centos container c1 and mount /data 
  docker run --name c2 -it -v /data centos

2 Go into the data folder create files in data folder
  cd data
  touch f1 f2

3  Come out of the container without exit
   ctlr+p,ctlr+q

4 Create another centos container c2 and it should used the voluems used by c1
  docker run --name c2 -it --volumes-from c1 centos
  
5 In the c2 container go into data folder and create some file
  cd data
  touch f3 f4

6 Come out of the container without exit
   ctlr+p,ctlr+q

7 Create another centos container c3 and it should use the volume used by c2
  docker run --name c3 -it --volumes-from c2 centos

8 In the c3 container go into data folder and create some file
  cd data
  touch f5 f6

9 Come out of the container without exit
   ctlr+p,ctlr+q

10 Go into any of the 3 contianers and we will see all the files
   docker attach c1
   cd /data
  ls
  exit

12 Identify the location the where the mounted data is stored
   docker inspect c1
   Search for "Mounts" section and copy the "Source" path

13 Delete all containers
   docker rm -f c1 c2 c3

14 Check if the files are still present
   cd "source_path_from"step12"

=======================================================================
Day 8
=======================================================================
Docker volume containers
----------------------------
These volumes are bidirectoinal ie the changes done on host
will be reflected into container and changes done by container
will be reflected to host machine

1 Create a volume 
  docker volume create myvolume

2 To check the location where the mounted the volume works
  docker volume inspect myvolume

3 Copy the path shown in "MountPoint" and cd to that Path
  cd "MountPoint"

4 Create few files here
  touch file1 file2

5 Create a centos container and mount the above volume into the tmp folder
  docker run --name c1 -it -v myvolume:/tmp centos

6 Change to tmp folder and check for the files
  cd /tmp
  ls
  If we create any files here they will be reflected to host machine
  And these files will be present on the host even after deleting the 
  container.

===========================================================================
UseCase
============
Create a volume "newvolume" and create tomcat-users.xml file in it
Create a tomcat container and mount the above volume into it
Copy the tomcat-users.xml files to the required location

1 Create a volume
  docker volume create newvolume

2 Identify the mount location
  docker volume inspect newvolume
  Copy the "MountPoint" path

3 Move to this path
  cd "MountPoint path"

4 Create a file called tomcat-users.xml
  cat > tomcat-users.xml
  <tomcat-users>
      <user username="intelliqit" password="intelliqit" roles="manager-script"/>
  </tomcat-users>

5 Create a tomcat container and mount the above volume
  docker run --name webserver -d -P -v newvolume:/tmp tomcat

6 Go into bash shell of the tomcat container
  docker exec -it webserver bash

7 Move the tomcat-users.xml file into conf folder
  mv /tmp/tomcat-users.xml conf/

==================================================================

Creating customsied docker images
=========================================
This can be done in 2 ways
1 Using docker commit command
2 Using dockerfile

Using the docker commit command
====================================
UseCase
============
Create an ubuntu container and install some s/w's in it
Save this container as an image and later create a new container
from the newly created image.We will find all the s/w's that we 
installed.

1 Create an ubuntu container
  docker run --name u1 -it ubuntu

2 In the container update the apt repo and install s/w's
  apt-get update
  apt-get install -y git

3 Check if git is installed or not
  git --version
  exit

4 Save the customised container as an image
  docker commit u1 myubuntu

5 Check if the new image is created or not
  docker images

6 Delete the previousely create ubuntu container
  docker rm -f u1

7 Create an new container from the above created image 
  docker run --name u1 -it myubuntu

8 Check for git 
  git --version


========================================================================

Dockerfile
===================
Dockerfile uses predefined keyword to create customsied
docker images.

Important keyword in dockerfile
===================================
FROM : This is used to specify the base image from where a
customised docker image has to be created

MAINTAINER : This represents the name of the organization or the
author that has created this dockerfile

RUN :Used to run linux commands in the container
     Generally it used to do s/w installtion or
     running scripts

USER : This is used to specify who should be the default user
       to login into the container

COPY : Used to copy files from host to the customised image that
       we are creating. 
       COPY simply the copy files which are present on the host machine into customized image we are creating
       where as ADD can do the same thing apart from that ADD also can download files from some remote servers into
       the customized images.

ADD : This is similar to copy where it can copy files from host
      to image but ADD can also downlaod files from some remote server

EXPOSE : USed to specify what port should be used by the container

VOLUME : Used for automatic volume mounting ie we will have a volume
         mounted automatically when the container start

WORKDIR : Used to specify the default working directory of the container



ENV : This is used to specify what environment varibles should
     be used

CMD : USed to run the default process of the container from outside
      
ENTRYPOINT : This is also used to run the default process of the container
             
LABEL: Used to store data about the docker image in key value pairs

SHELL : Used to specify what shell should be by default used by the image
============================================================================
Day 9
============================================================================
UseCase
===========
Create a dockerfile to use nginx as abse image and specify
the maintainer as intelliqit

1 Create docker file
vim dockerfile

FROM nginx
MAINTAINER intelliqit

2 To create an image from this file
  docker build -t mynginx .

3 Check if the image is created or not
  docker images

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
UseCase
==============
Create a dockerfile from ubuntu base image and install 
git in it

1 Create dockerfile
  vim dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu
  MAINTAINER intelliqit
  RUN apt-get update
  RUN apt-get install -y git

2 Create an image from the above file
  docker build -t myubuntu .

3 Check if the new image is created
  docker images

4 Create a container from the new image and it should have git installed
  docker run  --name u1 -it myubuntu
  git --version



=========================================================
Cache Busting
===================
When we create an image from a dockerfile docker stores all the 
executed isntructions in a its cache.Next time if we edit the
same docker file and add few new instructions and build an image
out of it docker will not execute the previously executed statements
Instead it will read them from the cache
This is a time saving mechanism
The disadvantage is if the docker file is edited with a huge time
gap then we might end up installing s/w's that are outdated

Eg: 
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y git

If we build an image from the above dockerfile docker saves all 
these instructions in the dockercache and if we add the below
statement
RUN apt-get install -y tree
only this latest statement will be excuted

To avoid this problem and make docker execute all the instructions 
once more time without reading from cache we use "cache busting"
docker build --no-cache -t myubuntu .
================================================================
Day 10
===============================================================




Create a shell script to install multiple s/w's and copy this
into the docker image  and execute it a the the time os creating the image

1 Create the shell script
  vim script.sh
  apt-get update
  for x in tree git wget
  do
      apt-get install -y $x
  done

2 Give excute permissions on that file
  chmod u+x script.sh 

3 Create the dockerfile
  vim dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu
  MAINTIANER intelliqit
  COPY ./script.sh /
  RUN ./script.sh

4 Create an image from the dockerfile
  docker build -t myubuntu .

5 Create a container from the above image
  docker run  --name u1 -it myubuntu

6 Check if the script.sh is present in / and also see if tree and git are installed
  ls  /
  git --version
  tree
=================================================================
Create a dockerfile from  base ubuntu image and make
/data as the default volume

1 Create a dockerfile
  vim dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu

Create a dockerfile from jenkins base image and make the default user as root

1 vim dockerfile
  FROM jenkins/jenkins
  MAINTAINER intelliqit
  USER root

2 Create an image from the above dcokerfile
  docker build -t myjenkins .

3 Create a container from the above image
  docker run --name j1 -d -P myjenkins

4 Go into the interactive shell and check if the default user is root
  docker exec -it j1 bash
  whoami

=========================================================================
Create a dockerfile from ubunt base image and downlaod jenkins.war
into it

1 Create a dockerfile
  vim dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu
  MAINTIANER intelliqit
  ADD https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.263.4/jenkins.war  /

2 Create an image from the above dockerfile
  docker build -t myubuntu .

4 Create a container from this image
  docker run --name u1 -it myubuntu
 
5 Check if jenkins.war is present
  ls
========================================================================
Create a dcoker file from nginx base image and expose 80 port 

1 vim dockerfile
  FROM nginx
  MAINTAINER intelliqit
  EXPOSE 90

2 Create an image
  docker build -t mynginx .

3 Create a container from above image
  docker run --name n1 -d -P mynginx 

4 Check for the ports exposed
  docker port n1


===========================================================================
Day 12
=============================================================================
Create a dcokerfile from ubuntu base image and install
java in it,docwnload jenkins.war and make
"java -jar jenkins.war" as the default process of the
container

1 vim dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu
  MAINTAINER intelliqit
  RUN apt-get update
  RUN apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk
  ADD https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.263.4/jenkins.war /
  ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","jenkins.war"]
  

2 Create an image from the above file
  docker build -t myubuntu .

3 Create a container from the above image and we will see that 
  it behaves like a jenkins container
  docker run  --name u1 -it myubuntu

4 Check the default process that is running
  docker container ls

======================================================================

==============================================================================
UseCase
=============
Create a dockerfile from ubuntu base image and make it behave
like nginx

1 Create a dockerfile
  vim dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu
  MAINTAINER intelliqit
  RUN apt-get update
  RUN apt-get install -y nginx
  ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/nginx","-g","daemon off;"]
  EXPOSE 80

2 Create an image from the above dockerfile
  docker build -t myubuntu .

3 Create a container from the above image and it will work like nginx
  docker run --name n1 -d -P myubuntu

4 Check the ports used by nginx
  docker container ls

5 To access nignx from browser
  public_ip_of_dockerhost:port_no_captured_from_step4




========================================================================

=======================================================================
CMD and ENTRYPOIT
------------------------
Bothe of them are used to specify the default process that should be
triggered when the container starts but the CMD instruction can be 
overridden with some other process passed at the docker run command

Eg:
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y nginx
CMD ["/usr/sbin/nginx","-g","daemon off;"]
EXPOSE 80

Though the default process is to trigger nginx we can bypass that
and make it work on some other process

docker build -t myubuntu .
Create a container
docker run --name u1 -it -d myubuntu
Here if we inspect the default process we will see that 
nginx as the default process
docker container ls

on the otherhand we can modify that default process to something else
docker run --name u1 -d -P myubuntu ls -la
Now if we do "docker container ls"  we will see the dafault process
to be "ls -la"

============================================================================
Day 13
============================================================================
Docker Networking
==========================
Docker supports 4 types of networks
1 Bridge
2 Host
3 Null
4 Overlay
========================================================================== 
UseCase
===============
Create 2 bridge networks intelliq1 and intelliq2
Create 2 busybox containers c1,c2 and c3
c1 and c2 should run on intelliq1 network and shoul ping each other
c3 should run on intelliq2 network and it should not be able to ping c1 or c2
Now put c2 on intelliq2 network,since c2 is on both intelliq1 and intelliq2
networks it should be able to ping to both c1 and c3
but c1 and c3 should not ping each other directly

1 Create 2 bridge networks
  docker network create --driver bridge intelliq1
  docker network create --driver bridge intelliq2

2 Check the list of available networks
  docker network ls

3 Create a busybox container c1 on intelliqi1 network
  docker run --name c1 -it --network intelliq1 busybox
  Come out of the c1 container without exit ctrl+p,ctrl+q

4 Identify the ipaddress of c1
  docker inspect c1

5 Create another busybox container c2 on intelliq1 network
  docker run --name c2 -it --network intelliq1 busybox
  ping ipaddress_of_c1    (It will ping)
  Come out of the c2 container without exit ctrl+p,ctrl+q

6 Identify the ipaddress of c2
  docker inspect c2

7 Create another busybox container c3 on intelliq2 network
  docker run --name c3 -it --network intelliq2 busybox
  ping ipaddress_of_c1  (It should not ping)
  ping ipaddress_of_c2  (It should not ping)
  Come out of the c3 container without exit ctrl+p,ctrl+q

8 Identify the ipaddress of c3
  docker inspect c3 

9 Now attach intelliq2 network to c2 container
  docker network connect intelliq2 c2

10 Since c2 is now on both intelliq1 and intelliq2 networks it should ping
   to both c1 and c3 containers
   docker attach c2
   ping ipaddress_of_c1  (It should  ping)
   ping ipaddress_of_c3  (It should  ping)
   Come out of the c2 container without exit ctrl+p,ctrl+q

11 But c1 and c3 should not ping each other
   docker attach c3
   ping ipaddress_of_c1  (It should not ping)


Note: To create network with a specific subnet range
docker network create --driver bridge --subnet=192.168.2.0/24 intelliqit3

======================================================================================


UseCase
=============
Create a custom bridge network and create a docker compose file

=========================================================================

Container Orchestration
==============================
This is the process of handling docker containers running
on multiple linux servers in a distributed environment


Advantages
=================
1 Load Balancing
2 Scalling
3 Rolling update
4 High Availability and Disaster recovery(DR)

LoadBalancing
==================
Each container is capable of sustaining a specific user load
We can increase this capacity by running the same application
on multiple containers(replicas)

Scalling
==============
We should be able to increase or decrease the number of containers
on which our applications are running without the end user
exepriencing any downtime.

Rolling update
=======================
Application running in a live environment should be upgraded or
downgraded to a different version without the end user having any
downtime

Disaster Recovery
======================
In case of network failuers or server crashes still the container
orchestration tools maintain the desired count of containers
and thereby provide the same service to the end user

Popular container orchestration tools
===========================================
1 Docker Swarm
2 Kubernetes
3 OpenShift
4 Mesos

===================================================================
Day 15
=====================================================================
===========================================================================
Setup of Docker Swarm
============================
1 Create 3 AWS ubuntu instances
2 Name them as Manager,Worker1,Worker2
3 Install docker on all of them
4 Change the hostname
  vim /etc/hostname
  Delete the content and replace it with Manager or Worker1 or Worker2
5 Restart
  init 6
6 To initilise the docker swarm
  Connect to Manager AWS instance
  docker swarm init
  This command will create a docker swarm and it will also generate
  a tokenid
7 Copy and paste the token id in Worker1 and Worker2

===============================================================================
TCP port 2376 for secure Docker client communication. This port is required for Docker Machine to work. Docker Machine is used to orchestrate Docker hosts.

TCP port 2377. This port is used for communication between the nodes of a Docker Swarm or cluster. It only needs to be opened on manager nodes.

TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes (container network discovery).
UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic (container ingress networking).

=========================================================================



Load Balancing:
Each docker containers has a capability to sustain a specific
user load.To increase this capability we can increase the 
number of replicas(containers) on which a service can run

UseCase
------------
Create nginx with 5 replicas and check where these replicas are
running

1 Create nginx with 5 replicas
  docker service create --name webserver -p 8888:80 --replicas 5 nginx

2 To check the services running in swarm
  docker service ls

3 To check where these replicas are running
  docker service ps webserver

4 To access the ngonx from browser
  public_ip_of_manager/worker1/worker2:8888

5 To delete the service with all replicas
  docker service rm webserver
=========================================================================
UseCase
===========
Create mysql with 3 replicas and also pass the necessary environment
variables

1 docker service create --name db --replicas 3 
                    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=intelliqit  mysql:5

2 To check if 3 replicas of mysql are running
  docker service ps db


=======================================================================
Scalling
============
This is the process of increasing the number of replicas or decreasing
the replicas count based on requirement without the end user experiencing
any down time.

UseCase
============
Create tomcat with 4 replicas and scale it to 8 and scale it
down to 2 

1 Create tomcat with 4 replicas
  docker service create --name appserver -p 9090:8080 --replicas 4 tomcat

2 Check if 4 replicas are running
  docker service ps appserver

3 Increase the replicas count to 8
  docker service scale appserver=8

4 Check if 8 replicas are running
  docker service ps appserver

5 Decrese the replicas count to 2
  docker service scale appserver=2

6 Check if 2 replicas are running
  docker service ps appserver



=======================================================================
Rolling updates
======================
Services running in docker swarm should be updated from once
version to other without the end user downtime

UseCase
===========
Create redis:3 with 5 replicas and later update it to redis:4
also rollback to redis:3

1 Create redis:3 with 5 replicas
  docker service create --name myredis --replicas 5 redis:3

2 Check if all 5 replicas of redis:3 are running
  docker service ps myredis

3 Perfrom a rolling update from redis:3 to redis:4
  docker service update --image redis:4 myredis

4 Check redis:3 replcias are shut down and in tis palce redis:4 replicas are running
  docker service ps myredis

5 Roll back from redis:4 to redis:3
  docker service update --rollback myredis

6 Check if redis:4 replicas are shut down and in its place redis:3 is running
  docker service ps myredis


================================================================================
To remove a worker from swarm cluster
docker node update --availability drain Worker1

To make this worker rejoin the swarm
docker node update --availability active Worker1

To make worker2 leave the swarm
Connect to worker2 usig git bash
docker swarm leave

To make manager leave the swarm
docker swarm leave --force

To generate the tokenid for a machine to join swarm as worker
docker swarm join-token worker

To generate the tokenid for a machine to join swarm as manager
docker swarm join-token manager

To promote Worker1 as a manager
docker node promote Worker1

To demote "Worker1" back to a worker status
docker node demote Worker1


=============================================================================
Day 16
=============================================================================
FailOver Scenarios of Workers
================================
Create httpd with 6 replicas and delete one replica running on the manager
Check if all 6 replicas are still running

Drain Worker1 from the docker swarm and check if all 6 replicas are running
on Manager and Worker2,make Worker1 rejoin the swarm

Make Worker2 leave the swarm and check if all the 6 replicas are
running on Manager and Worker1

1 Create httpd with 6 replicas
  docker service create  --name webserver -p 9090:80 --replicas 6 httpd

2 Check the replicas running on Manager
  docker service ps webserver | grep Manager

3 Check the container id
  docker container ls

4 Delete a replica
  docker rm -f container_id_from_step3

5 Check if all 6 replicas are running
  docker service ps webserver

6 Drain Worker1 from the swarm
  docker node update --availability drain Worker1

7 Check if all 6 replicas are still running on Manager and Worker2
  docker service ps webserver

8 Make Worker1 rejoin the swarm
  docker node update --availability active Worker1

9 Make Worker2 leave the swarm
  Connect to Worker2 using git bash
  docker swarm leave
  Connect to Manager
  
10 Check if all 6 replicas are still running
   docker service ps webserver


======================================================================
FailOver Scenarios of Managers
====================================
If a worker instance crashses all the replicas running on that
worker will be moved to the Manager or the other workers.
If the Manager itself crashes the swarm becomes headless 
ie we cannot perfrom container orchestration activites in this
swamr cluster

To avoid this we should maintain multiple managers
Manager nodes have the status as Leader or Reachable

If one manager node goes down other manager becomes the Leader
Quorum is resonsible for doing this activity and if uses a RAFT
algorithm for handling the failovers of managers.Quorum also 
is responsible for mainting the min number of manager

Min count of manager required for docker swarm should be always
more than half of the total count of Managers

Total Manager Count  -    Min Manager Required - Fault Tolerance
      1              -           1             -    0
      2              -           2             -    0
      3              -           2             -    1
      4              -           3             -    1
      5              -           3             -    2
      6              -           4             -    2
      7              -           4             -    3
      8              -           5             -    3


=================================================================================
=============================================================================
Overlay Networking
=========================
This is the deafult network used by swarm
and this network perfrom network load balancin
ie even if a service is running on a specicfic  worker we can
access if from orther slave

UseCase
=============
Start nginx with 2 repliacs and check if we can acces it from 
browser from manager and all workers

1 Create nginx
  docker service create  --name webserver -p 8888:80 --replicas 2 nginx

2 Check where these 2 replcas are running
  docker service ps webserver
  These repliacs will be running on only 2 nodes and we will have a third
  node where it it not running

3 Check if we can access nginx from the third node where it is not present
  public_ip_of_thirdnode:8888

=============================================================================
Day 17
============================================================================
UseCase
===========
Create 2 overlay networks intelliqit1 and intelliqit2
Create httpd with 5 replacs on intelliqit1 network
Create tomcat with 5 replicas on default overlay "ingres" network
and later perform rolling network update to intelliqit2 network

1 Create 2 overlay networks
  docker network create  --driver overlay intelliqit1
  docker network create  --driver overlay intelliqit2

2 Check if 2 overlay networks are created
  docker network ls

3 Create httpd with 5 replcias on inteliiqit1 network
  docker service create  --name webserver -p 8888:80 --replicas 5 
                                           --network intelliqit1 httpd

4 To check if httpd is running on intelliqit1 network
  docker service inspect webserver
  This command will generate the output in JSON format
  To see the above output in normal text fromat
  docker service inspect webserver --pretty

5 Create tomcat with 5 replicas on the deafult ingres network
  docker service create --name appserver -p 9999:8080 --replicas 5 tomcat

6 Perform a rolling network update from ingres to intelliqit2 network
  docker service update --network-add intelliqit2 appserver

7 Check if tomcat is now running on intelliqit2 network
  docker service inspect appserver --pretty

Note: To remove from intelliqit2 network
      docker service update --network-rm intelliqit2 appserver


===============================================================================
===============================================================================
Docker Stack
=====================
docker compose + docker swarm = docker stack
docker compose + kubernetes = kompose

Docker compose when implemented at the level of docker swarm
it is called docker stack.Using docker stack we can create an orchestreta
a micro services architecture at the level of production servers

1 To create a stack from a compose file
  docker stack deploy -c compose_filename stack_name

2 To see the list of stacks created
  docker stack ls

3 To see on which nodes the stack services are running
  docker stack ps stack_name

4 To delete a stack
  docker stack rm stack_name

=====================================================================
UseCase
================

===================================================================
Day 18
=========================================================================
Kubernetes
======================

Menions: This is an individual node used in kubernetes
Combination of these minions is called as Kubernetes cluster

Master is the main machine which triggers the container orchestraion
It distributes the work load to the Slaves

Slaves are the nodes that accept the work load from the master
and handle activites load balancing,autoscalling,high availability etc



Kubernetes uses various of types of Object

1 Pod: This is a layer of abstraction on top of a container.This is the samallest
  object that kubernetes can work on.In the Pod we have a container.
  The advantage of using a Pod is that kubectl commands will work on the Pod and the 
  Pod communicates these instructions to the container.In this way we can use the
  same  kubectl irresepective of which technology containers are in the Pod.



2 Service: This is used for port mapping and network load balancing

3 NameSpace: This is used for creating partitions in the cluster.Pods running
 in a namespace cannot communicate with other pods running in other namespace

4 Secrets: This is used for passing encrypted data to the Pods

5 ReplicationController: This is used for managing multiple replicas of PODs
and also perfroming saclling 

6 ReplicaSet: This is similar to replicationcontroller but it is more advanced
where features like selector can be implemented

7 Deployment: This used for perfroming all activites that a Replicaset can do
  it can also handle rolling update

8 PersistantVolume: Used to specify the section of storage that should be used for volumes

9 PersistantVolumeClaims: Used to reserver a certain amout of storage for a pod from the
  persistant volume.

10 Statefulsets: These are used to handle stateful application like data bases
  where consistency in read write operations has to be maintained.

11 HorrizontalPodAutScaller: Used for auto scalling of pods depending on the load


Kubernetes Architecture
=============================
Master Componentes
=======================
Container runtime: This can be docker or anyother container technology

apiServer: Users interact with the apiServer using some clinet like ui,command line tool like kubelet.It is the apiServer which is the gateway to the cluster
It works as a gatekeeper  for authentication and it validates if a specific
user is having permissions to execute a specific command.Example if we want to
deploy a pod or a deployment first apiServers validates if the user is authorised to perform that action and if so it passes to the next process
ie the "Scheduler"

Scheduler: This process accepts the instructions from apiServer after validation
and starts an application on a sepcific node or set of nodes.It estimates
how much amount of h/w is required for an application and then checks which
slave have the necessary h/w resources and instructs the kubelet to deploy
the application

kubelet: This is the actual process that takes the orders from scheduler and
deploy an application on a slave.This kubelet is present on both master and slave

controller manager: This check if the desired state of the cluster is always
maintained.If a pod dies it recreates that pod to maintain the desired state

etcd: Here the cluster state is maintained in key value pairs.
It maintains info about the slaves and the h/w resources available on
the slaves and also the pods running on the slaves
The scheduler and the control manager read the info from this etcd
and schedule the pods and maintain the desired state

===========================================================================
Worker components
=======================
containerrun time: Docker or some other container technology

kubelet: This process interacts with container run time and the node 
and it start a pod with a container in it

kubeproxy: This will take the request from services to pod
It has the intellegence to forward a request to
a near by pod.Eg If an application pod wants to communicate with a db pod
then kubeproxy will take that request to the nearby pod 

=============================================================================
